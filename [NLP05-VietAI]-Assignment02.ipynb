    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP and ML have gone through several phases of how models are trained in recent years. With the advent of diversified pretrained models, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks has become the standard practice. In this assignment, we are about to embark on an exciting journey into the instruction tuning methodâ€”a technique designed to make LLMs more useful. The techniques we'll delve into are not only robust but also resource-efficient, allowing us to perform the task of fine-tuning even on the free T4 GPUs available in Kaggle notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the techniques we will explore is **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, a method that has proven to be efficient and effective in adapting large pre-trained language models to specific tasks. LoRA is grounded in the hypothesis that updates to the weights during adaptation have a low \"intrinsic rank\", allowing us to constrain weight updates and reduce computational complexity, while preserving model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementing LoRA, we will also engage with **mixed-precision training**. This technique combines different numerical precisions to perform computations, aiming to maximize the computational power of modern GPUs. Mixed-precision training can accelerate model training, reduce memory requirements, and thus enable us to train larger, more powerful models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will delve into **distributed training**, a must-know technique for handling very large models or datasets. With distributed training, we can leverage multiple GPUs or even multiple machines to collectively train a single model, effectively overcoming the limitations posed by the memory capacity of individual GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should be well-acquainted with these cutting-edge techniques and be capable of integrating them into your own machine learning projects. Let's embark on this exciting journey into the vanguard of machine learning fine-tuning methodologies!"

    "\n",
    "The Stanford Alpaca dataset is a synthetic dataset developed by Stanford researchers and is part of a project that aims to build and share an instruction-following model called Alpaca. The dataset contains 52K examples used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model, with each example consisting of a unique instruction that the model should follow, an optional context or input for the task, and the corresponding output generated by the OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model. In thiss assigment, we will use an updated version - the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset - which also contains 52K instruction-following data but generated by GPT-4 with prompts in Alpaca. More information is available at the [Data release](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/README.md#data-release), the [Alpaca-GPT4](https://github.com/Instruction-Tuning-with-GPT-4/GPT-4-LLM#how-good-is-the-data) and [Alpaca project page](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html).\n",

In terms of benchmarking, Qwen2.5-72B stands out as a top-tier performer among open-source models. For example, Qwen2.5-72B achieves an MMLU score of 86.1, surpassing even larger models like LLaMA-3-405B.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Qwen2.5 series offers models ranging from 0.5 billion to 72 billion parameters, for this assignment, we will select Qwen2.5 1.5B, which aligns with our resource constraints.\n",

    "For our purposes, we will fine-tune the Qwen2.5 1.5B model using the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset. This assignment will allow us to simulate the supervised fine-tuning phase, similar to the process employed in the development of models like ChatGPT. By leveraging the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, we aim to enhance the Qwen2.5 1.5B's ability to follow instructions and perform tasks as specified by user\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation**, is a technique for adapting large language models to specific tasks or domains more efficiently. It's based on the observation that as models get larger, the conventional approach of full fine-tuning becomes less feasible due to the large number of parameters involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves injecting the matrices into the dense layer's update, optimizing them for the specific adaptation task while the original pretrained model weights remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key points of the LoRA technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Freezing Pretrained Weights**: Instead of modifying all the parameters of a pretrained model during fine-tuning, LoRA freezes the pretrained weights. This means that the original model weights remain unchanged during the adaptation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rank Decomposition Matrices**: LoRA freezes the pretrained model weights and *injects trainable rank decomposition matrices* into each layer of the Transformer architecture. These matrices are used to adjust the output of each layer in a way that's specific to the adaptation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indirect Training of Dense Layers**: The rank decomposition matrices allow for the indirect training of each dense layer in the neural network. They are injected into the layer's update during the adaptation process and optimized to enhance the layer's performance on the specific task or domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant Reduction in Trainable Parameters**: By focusing on these rank decomposition matrices instead of the entire set of model weights, LoRA greatly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For instance, in the case of GPT-3, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintaining Model Performance**: Despite the significant reduction in the number of trainable parameters, the LoRA technique is designed to maintain or even improve the performance of the large language model on the specific task or domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, LoRA is a method that tackles the challenge of adapting large language models to specific tasks or domains in a more efficient and feasible way, making the fine-tuning process more manageable and less resource-intensive."

    "### 2. Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRA technique introduces a mathematical concept known as low-rank approximation into the fine-tuning process of large language models. Here's a mathematical description of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA involves modifying the pre-trained weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$ of a neural network layer by introducing a low-rank parametrized update matrix $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r}$, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times k}$, and $r \\ll \\min(d, k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the adaptation process, $\\mathbf{W}_0$ is kept frozen, which means it does not receive any gradient updates. The trainable parameters are contained within $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, which form the low-rank update matrix $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that both $\\mathbf{W}_0$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$ are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed. If $\\mathbf{x}$ is the input and $\\mathbf{h} = \\mathbf{W}_0\\mathbf{x}$ is the output of the original weight matrix, the modified output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{h} = \\mathbf{W}_0\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{W}_0\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{W}_0 + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{x}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "in which $\\mathbf{W}_0 + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$ is called **merge** operation. We will implement it in this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, we initialize $\\mathbf{A}$ with a random Gaussian distribution and $\\mathbf{B}$ with zero, such that $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$ is zero, as shown in **Figure 1**. This ensures that the initial output of the model remains the same as in the pre-training phase, and the adaptation starts from the original model state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The low-rank update $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$ then evolves during training, helping to specialize the model for a specific task while keeping the number of trainable parameters manageable. Additionally, $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}$ is scaled by $\\frac{\\alpha}{r}$ where $\\alpha$ is a constant hyper-parameter. **(*)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is applied for each Linear layer of self-attention layer in the Qwen2.5 language model, leading to an adapted model that's specialized for a specific task or domain, with significantly fewer trainable parameters than the original model. For example, with GPT-3 175B, VRAM consumption during training is reduced from 1.2TB to 350GB. If $r = 4$ and only the query and value projection matrices are adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by approximately 10,000 times (from 350GB to 35MB). This allows training with significantly fewer GPUs and helps to avoid communication overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit is the ability to switch between tasks at a lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights, as opposed to all parameters. This enables the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out on the fly on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "**(*)** The reason for scaling the update $\\Delta W x$ by $\\frac{\\alpha}{r}$ is primarily for easier optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the scenario where the rank $r$ changes during training. If you were to increase or decrease $r$, without this scaling factor, it would significantly affect the magnitude of the weight updates and thereby the learning dynamics of the model. In other words, changing $r$ would mean that you need to retune the learning rate or other hyperparameters, which is a laborious and time-consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "By scaling the updates by $\\frac{\\alpha}{r}$, the authors make the learning process more robust to changes in $r$. $\\alpha$ is a constant, so this scaling factor effectively normalizes the magnitude of the updates relative to the rank of the low-rank approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, even when $r$ changes, the overall scale of the updates remains approximately constant, meaning you can use the same learning rate and other hyperparameters. This is advantageous because it makes the training process more efficient and less sensitive to the choice of $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this is a heuristic and it may not always provide the optimal solution for every problem or dataset, but it is a practical choice that often works well in practice."

    "- **LoraLayer** class: This is a base class that provides common functionality for both linear and embedding layers using the LoRA technique. It keeps track of LoRA parameters including the rank **r** and two sets of weights **lora_A** and **lora_B** (or **lora_embedding_A** and **lora_embedding_B** for the embedding layer). Two methods, **update_layer** and **update_layer_embedding**, are defined to update these parameters for linear and embedding layers, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear** and **Embedding** classes: These classes extend their corresponding PyTorch classes (**nn.Linear** and **nn.Embedding**) and the **LoraLayer** class. They initialize their superclasses as well as the LoRA parameters, and overwrite the **merge**, **unmerge**, and **forward** methods to implement the LoRA technique. The **merge** method combines the original weights of the layer with the LoRA weights, and **unmerge** undoes this operation. The **forward** method applies the layer operation either with or without the LoRA technique, depending on whether LoRA is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is heavily based on the internal codebase of ðŸ¤— PEFT library. ðŸ¤— PEFT, or **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, is a library for efficiently adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the modelâ€™s parameters.
